We invite submissions of both short (max. 100 words) and extended abstracts (max. 1000 words) for 30 minute-presentations followed by 15 min discussions. Submissions are welcome from both philosophers and computer scientists (as well as from other relevant disciplines, e.g, psychology, physics, â€¦). We hope that bringing these communities together will lead the conference participants to gain a more systematic and general understanding of the challenges related to generalizing causal models. We also welcome submissions that are skeptical of attempts at extending causal models or applying them to philosophical issues. Broadly, any submission on a topic related to expanding causal models, whether through generalizing their expressive power or applying them to novel systems would be pertinent to the conference theme.

Please submit your abstract, prepared for blind-review, via [Easychair](https://easychair.org/cfp/ECM2020). The submission deadline is May 17th.
