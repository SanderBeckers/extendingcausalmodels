### Unpublished

This is my PhD dissertation. Most of its content has been published in the articles above.

### Work in Progress

These papers contain ideas that I am still playing with, or have played with in the past. None of these are finished articles in any shape or form, but hopefully I will finish some of them in the future.

### Old Stuff

These are some of the papers and dissertations which I wrote as a student, hence they might not be worth spending much (if any) time on.
