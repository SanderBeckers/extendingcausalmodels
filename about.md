Welcome to my personal webpage, and thanks for taking the time to pay it a visit. I am currently a visiting postdoctoral research fellow at the Cornell University Department of Computer Science. 

I have a background in philosophy, mathematics, and Artificial Intelligence, and for the past five years I have been working across the boundary between philosophy of science and Artificial Intelligence. Before coming to Cornell, I wrote a PhD on the topic of Actual Causation at the University of Leuven, Department of Computer Science. My current research extends the work on causation into formal ethics. Concretely, I am now working on formalising definitions of responsibility, intention, and blameworthiness, taking formal definitions of causation as my starting point.

However my interests are not limited to these problems but span a much wider range of topics, such as the ethics of AI, the (ir)rationality of belief in the supernatural, the meaning of randomness, philosophy of mathematics, bounded rationality, Wittgenstein's philosophy, cultural relativism, and many more.

If you are interested in my work, then do not hesitate to send me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:Sander.Beckers@cornell.edu?Subject=Job%20Offer%20from%20[Fill%20in%20your%20prestigious%20university]" target="_top">Sander.Beckers@cornell.edu</a>.
